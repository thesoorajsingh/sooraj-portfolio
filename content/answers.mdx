there is most likely no right answer to the problem you're trying to solve right now, nor will there ever be.

more often than not, you'll find yourself in front of a larger-than-life problem, wondering what the right solution for it is and hoping to find it, asap. you can't because it doesn't exist. you just need to find what answer works best for your current circumstance and then improve upon it over time.

looking for a job? there is no perfect resume, there's just one you have to make with whatever you know right now, then improve that with feedback

designing a web-app? there is no perfect design, there's just one that you can optimise with all the knowledge you have right now and then build on top of that with feedback.

this is also common when looking for inspiration, where instead of finding new ideas, we often replicate existing ones because they're "perfect". no solution is perfect and odds are that the very thing you're inspired from was made as a solution that fits their requirements, doesn't necessarily mean it'll fit yours.

does this mean no problem has a solution? nope.

there are still problems that have objectively true answers, like, does this pineapple belong on my pizza? the answer is yes. don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

tldr; questions often don't have a right solution, move your focus from looking for the right solution to looking for a solution that works given current circumstances and then iterate on it.
